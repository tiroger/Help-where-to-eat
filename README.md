# RESTAURANT WEEK 2019

## Help! Where should I eat??

With one week left before the start of Restaurant Week 2019...


Combining:
1. NYC restaurant inspection data: Open data (csv)
2. 2018 restaurant week data: Kaggle (csv)
3. 2019 restaurant week data: NYC Official Guide (scrape)

Match 2018 violations to 2018 restaurant data to help inform consumer's decision for 2019.

We plan on using data from Open Data, Kaggle and NYC Official Guide. We will be extracting data from CSVs, and scraping the NYC Official Guide website, cleaning it up, and loading it into a Postgres database.

Our goal is that this resulting database could be used for quickly finding and visualizing information about NYC restaurants to help  to help inform consumer's decision for 2019 Restaurant Week.
