### Help! Where should I eat?

Our goal is that this resulting database can be used to quickly finding and visualizing information about NYC restaurants participating in Restaurant Week 2019 and help inform consumer's decision as to which restaurant to patron.

The database contains information about all restaurants participating in Restaurant Week 2019. The database includes the following information for each restaurant:
- Restaurant Name
- Address and phone number
- Cuisine type
- Inspection score and grade
- Consumer Rating
- Top special

The database was created by combining the following datasets:

- NYC restaurant inspection data: [Open data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j), available as a csv file
- Open Table: obtained from scraping the restaurant week [page](https://www.opentable.com/promo.aspx?covers=2&currentview=list&datetime=2019-07-22+19%3A00&latitude=40.803606&longitude=-73.981648&metroid=8&promoid=69&ref=412&size=100&sort=Name)

### Questions we can answer:

Are there any Michelin-Starred Restaurants?
What are the top 10 restaurant types? How do the reviews say about the top 10 restaurant types?
Does price serve as the factor affecting the average review / ambience review / value review / food review / service review?
